# Unity-A-Star-Visualizer
Unity 6.2 project. A Star pathfinding

## Content

This project features a simple implementation of the A-Star Pathfinder.

A virtual grid is created in code, which is used to find the best path between a start and a goal.

In a scene, objects are created to show what path has been created, and to add obstacles to avoid.
